# How this thing work?

### Documentation 

`main.py` - that`s a file which i created for the main functionality of the bot. I think that it is working only with God's help because I can't imagine how i pursuaded it to work. 
- import sqlite3 - that's a module which is needed to connect before work
- import contextlib - to be honest i can't remember why is it used for
- import asyncio - that's used for async functions
- from aiogram.types import ChatJoinRequest, InlineKeyboardMarkup, InlineKeyboardButton - that's needed for the bot's work
- from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher, F - the same as the previous
- import logging - that's for logs in terminal
- BOT_TOKEN = 'your value here' - that thing you should take from Telegra BotFather
- CHANNEL_ID = -your value here - that thing you should take from GetMyId Bot in Telegran
- ADMIN_ID - the same thing as previous
